Take a distributed lock in a shared SQL Server database.

In F#:

    #r "Sproc.Lock.dll"
    open System
    open Sproc.Lock.Fun

    let connString = "sql server connection string"

    let lock1 = GetGlobalLock connString (TimeSpan.FromMinutes 5.) "MyAppLock"

    match lock1 with
    | Locked l ->
        sprintf "I got a lock called %s!" l.LockId
        // (will be "MyAppLock" on this occassion)
    | Unavailable ->
        sprintf "Someone else had the lock already!"
    | Error i ->
        sprintf "Something went wrong - error code: %d" i

    lock1.Dispose()

And C#:

    using System;
    using Sproc.Lock.OO;


    namespace MyApp
    {
        class Thing
        {
            static void DoLockRequiringWork()
            {
                var provider = new LockProvider("sql connection string");
                try
                {
                    using (var lock2 = provider.GlobalLock("MyAppLock", TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5.0))
                    {
                        // If I get here, I've got a lock!                    
                        // Doing stuff!
                    } // Lock released when Disposed
                }
                catch (LockUnavailableException)
                {
                    // Couldn't get the lock                
                    throw;
                }
                catch (LockRequestErrorException)
                {
                    // Getting the lock threw an error
                    throw;
                }
            }
        }
    }

Documentation
-------------

Sproc.Lock is a combination of a managed .net library and a set of SQL Server scripts that
combine to turn SQL Server into a distributed locking server.

This library is only really recommended if you are already using SQL Server, and do not
have a more suitable distibuted locking server already up and running. In that case, Sproc.Lock
can save you the overhead of adding an additional piece of infrastructure to your environment
